This repository has the Shadowsocks service used by Outline servers. It was inspired by [go-shadowsocks2](https://github.com/shadowsocks/go-shadowsocks2), and adds a number of improvements to meet the needs of the Outline users.

The Outline Shadowsocks service allows for:
- Multiple users on a single port.
  - Does so by trying all the different credentials until one succeeds.
- Multiple ports
- Whitebox monitoring of the service using [prometheus.io](https://prometheus.io)
  - Includes traffic measurements and other health indicators.
- Live updates via config change + SIGHUP
- Replay defense (add `--replay_history 10000`).  See [PROBES](service/PROBES.md) for details.

## Try it!

Fetch dependencies for this demo:
```
GO111MODULE=off go get github.com/shadowsocks/go-shadowsocks2 github.com/prometheus/prometheus/cmd/...
```
If that doesn't work, download the [prometheus](https://prometheus.io/download/) or [go-shadowsocks2](https://github.com/shadowsocks/go-shadowsocks2/releases) binaries directly.


### Run the server
On Terminal 1, from the repository directory, build and start the SS server:
```
go run . -config config_example.yml -metrics localhost:9091 --replay_history=10000
```
In production, you may want to specify `-ip_country_db` to get per-country metrics. See [how the Outline Server calls outline-ss-server](https://github.com/Jigsaw-Code/outline-server/blob/master/src/shadowbox/server/outline_shadowsocks_server.ts).


### Run the Prometheus scraper for metrics collection
On Terminal 2, start prometheus scraper for metrics collection:
```
$(go env GOPATH)/bin/prometheus --config.file=prometheus_example.yml
```

### Run the SOCKS-to-Shadowsocks client
On Terminal 3, start the SS client:
```
$(go env GOPATH)/bin/go-shadowsocks2 -c ss://chacha20-ietf-poly1305:Secret0@:9000 -verbose  -socks localhost:1080
```

### Fetch a page over Shadowsocks
On Terminal 4, fetch a page using the SS client:
```
curl --proxy socks5h://localhost:1080 example.com
```

Stop and restart the client on Terminal 3 with "Secret1" as the password and try to fetch the page again on Terminal 4.

### Check the metrics
Open http://localhost:9091/metrics and see the exported Prometheus variables.

Open http://localhost:9090/ and see the Prometheus server dashboard.


## Performance Testing

Start the iperf3 server (runs on port 5201 by default):
```
iperf3 -s
```

Start the SS server (listening on port 9000):
```
go run . -config config_example.yml
```

Start the SS tunnel to redirect port 8000 -> localhost:5201 via the proxy on 9000:
```
$(go env GOPATH)/bin/go-shadowsocks2 -c ss://chacha20-ietf-poly1305:Secret0@:9000 -tcptun ":8000=localhost:5201" -udptun ":8000=localhost:5201" -verbose
```

Test TCP upload (client -> server):
```
iperf3 -c localhost -p 8000
```

Test TCP download (server -> client):
```
iperf3 -c localhost -p 8000 --reverse
```

Test UDP upload:
```
iperf3 -c localhost -p 8000 --udp -b 0
```

Test UDP download:
```
iperf3 -c localhost -p 8000 --udp -b 0 --reverse
```

### Compare to go-shadowsocks2

Run the commands above, but start the SS server with
```
$(go env GOPATH)/bin/go-shadowsocks2 -s ss://chacha20-ietf-poly1305:Secret0@:9000 -verbose
```


### Compare to shadowsocks-libev 

Start the SS server (listening on port 10001):
```
ss-server -s localhost -p 10001 -m chacha20-ietf-poly1305 -k Secret1 -u -v
```

Start the SS tunnel to redirect port 10002 -> localhost:5201 via the proxy on 10001:
```
ss-tunnel -s localhost -p 10001 -m chacha20-ietf-poly1305 -k Secret1 -l 10002 -L localhost:5201 -u -v
```

Run the iperf3 client tests listed above on port 10002.

You can mix and match the libev and go servers and clients.

## Tests and Benchmarks

To run the tests and benchmarks, call:
```
make test
```

You can benchmark the cipher finding code with
```
go test -cpuprofile cpu.prof -memprofile mem.prof -bench . -benchmem -run=^$ github.com/Jigsaw-Code/outline-ss-server/shadowsocks
```

You can inspect the CPU or memory profiles with `go tool pprof cpu.prof` or `go tool pprof mem.prof`, and then enter `web` on the prompt.

## Release

We use [GoReleaser](https://goreleaser.com/) to build and upload binaries to our [GitHub releases](https://github.com/Jigsaw-Code/outline-ss-server/releases).

Summary:
- Test the build locally:
  ```
  make release-local
  ```
- Export an environment variable named `GITHUB_TOKEN` with a temporary repo-scoped GitHub token ([create one here](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new)):
  ```bash
  export GITHUB_TOKEN=yournewtoken
  ```
- Create a new tag and push it to GitHub e.g.:
  ```bash
  git tag v1.0.0
  git push origin v1.0.0
  ```
- Build and upload:
  ```bash
  make release
  ```
- Go to https://github.com/Jigsaw-Code/outline-ss-server/releases, review and publish the release.

- Delete the Github token you created for the release on the [Personal Access Tokens page](https://github.com/settings/tokens).

## FAQ

### LANTERN-SPECIFIC: Adding prefixes to Shadowsocks packets

Sometimes you'd need to add a specific prefix to the packets the client sends to fool a Censor. See this [particular case for example](https://github.com/getlantern/lantern-internal/issues/4428#issuecomment-1337979698).

You can do that with this fork like this:

* Client initialization:

        // See client/client.go for more info
        client, err := client.NewClient(
          whateverHost, whateverPort, whateverPassword, whateverCipher,
          &client.ClientOptions{Prefix: prefix},
        )

* Server initialization:

        // See service/tcp.go for more info
        proxy := service.NewTCPService(
          whateverCipherList,
          whateverCache,
          whateverMetrics,
          whateverTimeout,
          &service.TCPServiceOptions{Prefix: prefix},
        )

Note that the two prefixe above **must** be the same, else all packets are dropped.

There's a specific prefix we use for some Iranian tracks in `prefix/dnsovertcp.go`. The test for it is in `integration_test/integration_test.go:TestTCPEchoWithDNSOverTCPPrefix`. Use it as a reference.

**Important Note** while it is possible to do this in UDP as well, for now, we've only written the code for TCP messages (i.e., with `service/tcp.go`)

#### Code Path

For writing the prefix (i.e., client-side):

- `shadowsocks/stream.go:Writer` buffers write calls until it reaches a specific length, then it sends them as one TCP packet over the wire in `shadowsocks/stream.go:Writer.flush()`
- `shadowsocks/stream.go:Writer.flush()` handles assembling the Shadowsocks packet (e.g., encrypting each block, prepending the block size and salt)
- If a prefix exists, it'll be prepended **before** the salt (i.e., as the first bytes of each TCP PSH/ACK packet)

For reading the prefix (i.e., server-side), we have to first talk about how a TCP Shadowsocks packet header (i.e., first few bytes) is usually handled:

- When a TCP Shadowsocks connection first occurs between client and server, the client calls `client/client.go:ssClient.DialTCP()`
  - Then the server accepts the connection inside the infinite loop in `service/tcp.go:tcpService.Serve()`
  - And calls `service/tcp.go:tcpService.handleConnection()`, which calls `service/tcp.go:findAccessKey()` which does two things:
    - Reads the socket to check if the shadowsocks packet is correctly assembled (i.e., the salt and blocksize make sense)
    - Then **puts back** whatever it read in a new reader and the flow continues
- Afterwards, reads occur inside `shadowsocks/stream.go:chunkReader:ReadChunk()` **as if** it was reading from the wire for the first time

So the prefix reading **must occur in two locations**, not just one:

- When checking the packet header in `service/tcp.go:findAccessKey()`
  - Then we put everything back, including the prefix
- And when we actually read the packet inside `shadowsocks/stream.go:chunkReader:ReadChunk()`
  - This is where we absorb the prefix indefinitely

the prefix reading **can** be simplified to one location but it's best to keep it in the above two locations since this is a fork of [outline-ss-server](https://github.com/Jigsaw-Code/outline-ss-server) and it's best **not** to change the structure of the code dramatically to make rebasing easier.

#### What happens when a client sends a packet with a prefix to a server not expecting it or vice versa?
